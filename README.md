# PHP PDO Library

is a simple PHP PDO Library, it was inspired at these following repositories:

- [arvinkent17/Dynamic-PDO-](https://github.com/arvinkent17/Dynamic-PDO-)
- [kevinkabatra/PHP-PDO-Library](https://github.com/kevinkabatra/PHP-PDO-Library)

and I also uses a PHP class autoloader coming from [riptutorial.com](https://riptutorial.com/php/example/13197/autoloading)
